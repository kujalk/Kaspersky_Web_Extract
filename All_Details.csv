VirWare,Virus,Win9x,Memorial,https://threats.kaspersky.com/en/threat/Virus.Win9x.Memorial/,"['\n', '\n', '\nMemorial is a very interesting Windows 95 virus. There has been a long', '\ndevelopment in Windows virus writing so far [end of 1997]. However, the list', '\nof Windows 95 infectors is still not long. Memorial shows new ideas by', '\nbeing a “memory resident” Windows 95 virus. That is, it infects DOS-based', '\nCOM and EXE files as well as Win32 PE (Portable Executable) files,', '\nrespectively. The main format of the virus is a Windows 95 VxD (Virtual', '\nDevice Driver).', '\n', '\nThe virus is not encrypted in DOS-based COM and EXE files, but rather infected PE', '\nfiles are encrypted with an oligomorphic (semi-polymorphic) routine.', '\nMoreover, the main virus body (the VxD image) is packed with a simple', '\nalgorithm. There is already one virus encrypted in PE files', '\n(called Win95.Mad), but Memorial is certainly the first Windows 95 virus that shows oligomorphic capabilities. Thus, it makes the first step on the', '\nway of Windows 95 polymorphism.', '\n', '\nMemorial is also an effective retro-virus. It manipulates the Windows 95', '\nregistry to disable several well-known antivirus programs.', '\n', '\nFortunately, the virus has a few big bugs, which can slow down the spreading', '\na lot. However, Memorial.12413 has been reported to be “in the wild” in Sweden,', '\nregardless of these problems.', '\n', '\nWhen an infected COM file with Memorial is executed, the virus drops a VxD', '\nfile to the root of the C: drive called C:CLINT.VXD. First it checks whether', '\nWindows is currently running. If it is, the virus simply executes the DOS', '\nhost program. Otherwise, it makes its “Are you there” call, which is INT 2Fh', '\nAX=0. If, upon returning from the call, the AX register is set to 4AB3h, the', '\nvirus assumes it is already active in memory, and returns control to the', '\nhost program. Then it creates the C:CLINT.VXD file with a hidden attribute,', '\nand starts to write into it.', '\n', '\nThe writing routine appears as an anti-heuristic function. However, the', '\ngoal of this function is different. The main body of the virus is packed to', '\n7508 bytes, and this function is supposed to unpack it. The algorithm is very', '\nsimple, but effective. VxD files are in LE (Linear Executable) format. The', '\nstructure of these files contains many zeros. This is why the packing of', '\nthese areas can be quite effective. Basically, the full VxD is packed to', '\n7508 bytes, which grows to 12413 after unpacking. When the CLINT.VXD is', '\nready, Memorial copies a piece of code from itself into the Interrupt', '\nVector Table at 0:200, and hooks INT 2Fh (Multiplex Interrupt). This way the', '\nvirus does not have to worry about how to allocate memory, but it will be', '\nincompatible with some applications.', '\n', '\nThe INT 2Fh handler answers the “Are you there call”, and waits for 1605h in', '\nAX register to check the Windows Initialization Notification. This message', '\nnotifies DOS device drivers and TSRs that standard or 386 enhanced-mode', '\nWindows is starting. Windows calls this function as it starts to allow DOS', '\ndevice drivers and TSRs that monitor INT 2Fh the opportunity to prepare for', '\nrunning in the Windows environment.', '\n', '\nWhen this initial calls comes into the Memorial’s interrupt handler, the', '\nvirus opens C:CLINT.VXD to check for its existence. If the opening was', '\nsuccessful, Memorial initializes a Win386_Stratup_Info_Struc structure to', '\ndirect Windows to load the VxD. Any device driver or TSR can use a Windows', '\nVxD to help support its operation in the Windows environment. To specify', '\nthe VxD name, the device driver or TSR sets the SIS_Virt_Dev_File_Ptr member', '\nto the address of the virtual device’s filename. Thus, Memorial uses a', '\ndocumented means of directing Windows to load C:CLINT.VXD. This is a more', '\nelegant than modifying the SYSTEM.INI file’s device section, which is', '\nmore complicated and not so successful.', '\n', '\nBecause the extractor code does not know about this possible problem it', '\nwrites megabytes of code into C:CLINT.VXD until it fills all the available', '\nhard drive space, but even then the control will not come back to DOS. When', '\nusing Ctrl-C during this operation or restarting the machine, the huge', '\nC:CLINT.VXD can be find but only if the /AH (display hidden files) option', '\nof DIR command is used. Thus the virus in EXE files can be classified as', '\n“Intended”. Fortunately, the detection and disinfection of these files', '\nremains possible.', '\n', '\nAs in case of COM infection the virus also drops the C:CLINT.VXD from PE', '\nfiles. In case of DOS infections the dropper function takes 275 bytes', '\nadditional code at the entry point of the virus. In PE files this function', '\nis in 32bit code and it is more complicated than the DOS version of it.', '\nThis is why this code is longer: 1360 bytes. This function also includes', '\nMemorial’s activation routine and it is supposed to load the VxD, too.', '\n', '\nFirst the virus calculates GetModuleHandleA function’s entry-point in', '\nmemory. It does this by using a real hack; it makes a search in internal', '\nWindows 95 structures. This makes the PE infection a bit more easier later', '\non; the virus should not add any names to the Imported Names Table.', '\nMemorial does not need a complicated patch function in its PE infection', '\ncode for this purpose.', '\n', '\nLater on it calculates the entry point of GetProcAddress by using the same', '\ntrick. Then it uses GetModuleHanldeA to get the handle of KERNEL32 module.', '\nBy using this handle Memorial is able to call GetProcAddress to get and', '\nsave CreateFileA-, WriteFile-, ReadFile-, SetFilePointer-, CloseHandle-,', '\nGetLocalTime-, LocalAlloc procedures addresses respectively. After this it', '\nuses GetModuleHandleA again, to get USER32’s handle. Then it uses', '\nGetProcAddress again to save the address of MessageBox procedure.', '\n', '\nAfter this the virus calls GetLocalTime function to check the date: if it', '\nis 10 April the virus activates and displays a message box by using the', '\nMessageBox procedure:', '\n', '\nThis procedure hooks the DOS IFS (Installable File System) API call first.', '\nAfter this it deletes several keys from the Windows 95’s registry under', '\n‘SystemCurrentControlSetServicesVxd’, where statically loaded VxD names', '\ncan be found; such as anti virus VxDs. First it deletes ‘VETMON95’ and', '\n‘VETMACRO’ keys . Then it deletes ‘NAVAP’, ‘virusafe’, ‘WIMMUN32’ keys.', '\nThen it opens ‘SOFTWAREMicrosoftWindowsCurrentVersionRun’ section and', '\ndeletes the following values from it: ‘NORTON AUTO-PROTECT’, ‘TBAV for', '\nWindows 95’, ‘Anywhere Antivirus Validation’, ‘Vshwin32EXE’ and ‘ViruSafe’.', '\nThen it goes to ‘SOFTWAREMcAfeeScreenScan’ and deletes', '\n‘bEnableScreenScan’, ‘bScanAllFiles’, ‘bScanSubDirs’. Then deletes the', '\nfollowing keys under  ‘SOFTWARECybecVET Antivirus for Win32’:', '\n‘ActionsInfectedAction’, ‘ActionsSuspectAction’, ‘MemoryEnabled’,', '\n‘ResidentFileCheck’, ‘ResidentInfectedAction’, ‘ResidentSuspectAction’,', '\n‘ScanningScan All Files’, ‘ScanningScan Type’, ‘ScanningSkip Renamed’,', '\n‘ScanningSubfolders’ and sets the ‘ScanningExtension List’ value to ‘bin,', '\ndll, doc, drv, ovl, sys, dot’ removing ‘com, exe and possibly ‘scr’ from', '\nthis list. This way Memorial disables many  Windows 95 antivirus programs.', '\n', '\nThen the virus clears the attributes on C:CLINT.VXD. After this it opens', '\nthe file and gets and saves its size, and allocates enough memory for its', '\nunpacked and packed copy. Then it reads itself from the file to the main', '\nbuffer. Memorial then closes the VxD file and deletes it.', '\n', '\nAfter this it packs the VxD code into the second buffer. Finally it returns', '\nfrom its initialization routine.', '\n', '\nThen Memorial adds the DOS dropper code (275 bytes) to the end of the', '\nvictim together with the packed virus image (7508) bytes. Finally it', '\nmodifies the begging of the victim by changing the first 4 bytes to an', '\ninitial jump + a ‘Z’ marker and sets the attribute to the original one.', '\nThus the size of the virus is 7783 bytes in case of COM infection.', '\n', '\nBasically it uses an 8 bit XOR for the encryption. During the encryption it', '\ncalculates a check byte and saves it as the last character of the section', '\nname string. This additional byte will be used when checking existing PE', '\ninfections. Memorial mutates the section name during DOS EXE infections', '\nonly. This makes the mutation slow enough (slow oligomorphism).', '\n', '\nWhen this one is ready Memorial opens the victim, reads it header and', '\nchecks for the ‘MZ, ‘ZM’ signature. Then it reads 4 bytes from 3Ch position', '\nof the file. This double word holds a pointer to the Windows executables', '\nheader area. If this pointer is 0 the virus assumes that the file is a', '\nnormal DOS EXE file and tries to infect it as such. The it checks the', '\nchecksum field of the EXE header. If this one is 6666h the virus does not', '\ninfect the file, additionally if the IP field is 100h in the header the', '\nvirus wont infect either.', '\n', '\nThen the virus increases the size of EXE files to the paragraph boundary', '\nand add the VxD dropper code (275 bytes) to the end of the file.

In case of Win32 files it is more', '\nsophisticated, but also quite silly and short.', '\n', '\nSo the virus in infected files just creates and runs the dropper – no more, and', '\nall infection and payload virus functions falls on the Win32 virus dropper.', '\n', '\nThe virus then checks the system where it is run (Windows95/98 or Windows', '\nNT), and in case of Windows9x patches system undocumented process database', '\nand sets two flags in it – NukeProcess and ServiceProcess.

To enable these flags the virus then re-executes its dropper with', '\n“sexy” ID argument.', '\n', '\nBeing executed under patched system environment the virus jumps to its', '\nother routines: anti-anti-virus routine, payload and infection.', '\n', '\n', '\nThe virus gets the AVPI file name by using the system registry.

In case of EXE file the virus then checks', '\nPortable Executable and virus ID stamps – double words “PE” at the top of', '\nthe header and “I M!” in the PE CheckSum field. While adding its code to', '\nthe end of Portable Executable files the virus creates a new section named', '\n_Mylene_, modifies Address of Entry Point and some other necessary fields.', '\nIt then runs the polymorphic engine, encrypts its copy and writes it to the', '\nend of PE file into the newly created section.', '\n', '\nIn case of COM file the virus also writes itself to the end of the file,', '\nbut also converts file format to EXE by adding EXE header to the top of the', '\nfile.

The virus does not infect as', '\nwell files that have “ENUN” text string at the end of the files.

If there', '\nis no Windows run, or Windows version is less that 4.0 (Windows95), the', '\nvirus restores original host program bytes at its top and returns control', '\nto there.
